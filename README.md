My dotfiles

Pretty self explanitory.....

DISCLAIMER: I did not write the code in bin.contrib/bin directory. 
I did write all the code in bin/bin except part of bin/bin/i3exit, however I did right most of that script.
I have not put any copyright notices on any code I do not have copyright for.
I have not removed the copyright notice from any code that contained copyright notices.
